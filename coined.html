BLUE: i'm happy.
BLUE: but it doesn't mean i don't have to stand over this garden of death.

RED: what will you do?

BLUE: i have to mitigate the stress's effects on my body.
BLUE: the simplest way is through fasting. when there's food in your body it takes up time to digest.

RED: isn't it lame that we're named after colors? it's like assigned gender.

BLUE: i think it's kind of postmodern. if we are parts of god, it's like we're the same person.

BLUE: if we are the universe experiencing itself across different timelines, it's like we're all god's fanfiction.
BLUE: it's like we're all the same spiritual ghost getting in a huge line to use the next body, over and over again.
BLUE: we're all astral projecting into each other's self.

RED: but that's wrong you idiot.
RED: names are their own words. they have a unique meaning. they're passed on through our ancestors.
RED: those lines mean something.
RED: we're not all soup.
RED: i wouldn't even call it soup. there's no nutrients in it.
RED: it's rather and ocean of molten plastic, don't you think?

BLUE: i hate that game.
BLUE: i hate shit about ghosts.
BLUE: it's like they're trying to express a point about life, what they desire it to be, through a contradiction.
BLUE: the afterlife.
BLUE: there's no afterlife, just life.
BLUE: fuck ghost shit. there's no ghosts.

    <h1>i am <i>luke moody</i>, <br>a ghost in a human body.</h1>

    <p>welcome to my <i>iota</i> of internet</p>

    <p>this isn't how i wanted this to go, but in an awkward twist of events, i was forced to call out my abuser.</p>

    <p> i don't want to be angry anymore. anger and pain are bleach to the brain. i feel like it's corroding me.
    it makes me forget who i am. i've stewed in these emotions for 5 years, never finding the right moment, the right way to speak. communication is a delicate art. a communication is more than just words transmitted 
    from one person to another. environment matters. vibes matter. the community matters. the right person can manipulate all of these factors to make the victim look like the abuser. it's been a long game, but i finally
    have one <i>iota</i> of proof that ruben is a liar.</p>

    <p>today, december 3rd, is ruben's birthday, and today they are baptized, seen for who they really are. beheld.<br>

    i used to think this name was so beautiful &amp; powerful for a trans man. i loved the name so much i wouldn't dare say it, like the name of god. but ruben isn't god. ruben isn't even a man. ruben is <i>nothing.</i> <br></p>

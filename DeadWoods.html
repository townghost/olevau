I was raised on Nirvana. When I began to come into my own taste, I found grungy sort of electronic music interesting. I love the desolate sound of depression, the blue lonely hours on a dirt road in a town you&rsquo;ll never escape. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I escaped that town. I went to San Francisco. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My name is Lukas. I recently found out that one of my favorite albums, Odd Nosdam&rsquo;s Level Live Wires, was recorded in 2007 in Oakland. Those sounds, particularly the sound of that song, Burner, reminded me so much of the sound of trains going through my hometown.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I gave that album to one of my counselors at the homeless youth service I went to when I was 22. I wished he was my dad, my best friend, I loved him so much. I love those people so much because I was so alone. I always dreamed of the Bay Area not knowing what it was that I was dreaming of. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe someone was dreaming of me too. Sometimes I feel a little delusional, a little psychic. And I think that another universe is calling out to me. Someone from another universe misses me. A friend that wished I was there. Someone I never met wanted to meet me sooner. I feel something precious passing by. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I saw people from Oakland watching a movie that was made there and about Oakland. It was like Trinidad, but not. These people were witnessing something come full circle. They were home. Their hearts finally told a story. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t die because I need to be home. I need to create something. I can&rsquo;t be lost. I&rsquo;m Lukas. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve always dreamed of being in California. I missed so many people I had never met. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">San Francisco called to me before I ever knew I was trans. It was my destiny city. I dreamed of a city full of buildings that are too close together, looking out of the window of my white apartment to see the light reflecting off another building. Love me like dirt. Feed me with organic matter, stir me up and keep me dank. I&rsquo;ll produce something. The seeds are there.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They assume most people are straight. I guess I assume most people are gay. There wouldn&rsquo;t be any limits on love. I figured out early I could love anybody. Love is the exciting idea that I want to share with people. I want to form my own love bubbles with everybody. It wasn&rsquo;t until I got older that I saw people were holding back love and friendship. That was how it was done. You hold back, just giving crumbs. Leaving them hungry. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Love is a garden, it starts with dirt and dead things, and then you stir it up and dig it and water it. Roots go down and shoots come up. You might find stuff buried there. I used to dig up old toys and junk in the backyard of the house we used to live in. We had a basement and a toilet that was falling in. My grammie lived in a trailer in the backyard. My dad and brother lived there. Sooner or later everyone left. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But when I left, it was 2015. I was born in 1994 and I saw Gorillaz and Nirvana and Aesop Rock and H***s****k. I was transgender and gay and in love and I loved music and art. I never had a smartphone until I was 21, I never gamed. I had dirt and weeds and seeds, and I&rsquo;m unique and in love. I remembered the Juniper berries from my home. I had the deer antler and mountain lion footprint. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c6 c4 c8">let&#39;s soak our toes in champagne, let&#39;s dance on a lonely street</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4 c8 c9">let&#39;s kick up a cloud of dust and shake our heads to a fancy beat</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c6 c4 c8">let&#39;s squish the life out of everything and cheer through a swanky ghost</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4 c8">let&#39;s bathe in a cup of dreams and share in a saucy toast</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before I left home, I had a dream: I found a diamond on the ground and picked it up. I put it in the pocket of my coat. I looked it up and it was about a relationship, purity. But it was literal. I found a real diamond in Golden Gate Park. When I woke up I drew the dream. I put it on my tumblr. I never drew art on tumblr, it felt so weird and unfitting. I never fit in there. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My heart wrecked around and tried to kill me. I tried to kill myself through not eating. I tried to ruin my body with drugs. I tried to get a disease and die. I tried to piss off dangerous people and die. I tried to cut myself to death. I tried to drown myself to death. I tried to make life so unworth living because I had lost my only friend. My guide to this world. My partner. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I never felt such pain. I almost didn&rsquo;t look at the beauty of my home. Everything flashed by me in my tears, in my broken mind. I felt like acid was dripping from my every pore, like anybody who touched me would trip. Everything meant something, everything was me. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My feelings. My feelings were so beautiful. I felt such unique, textured, spacious feelings. Colorful, savory, sweet, warm, soft feelings. Feelings of inspiration and hope. I wanted to share those feelings. I wanted to be in those feelings with someone. I wanted to make those feelings a space where people could go. A home, a world. I wanted to Be. There were times when I felt like others were feeling my feelings. Like they were in the house of my soul. My heart! We shared inspiration. It made me feel real. I was hope, color, softness, texture, light, smell and taste. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">Cause you, you are an imaginary person</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">You&#39;re in my head but I am certain, you are real</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;And when I died, </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was stripped down to nothing, not even a concept. My name didn&rsquo;t belong to me. My name was Light, wordless. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">But my name is Lukas. I&rsquo;m from dirt. I&rsquo;m a weed, cercocarpus, the browsed. I have those fluffy curls. Mountain Mahogany. Black Cat. Diamond Finder. I can&rsquo;t forget to be married, I just wait time. I&rsquo;m a stopwatch. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c4">I can&#39;t help but think that you&#39;re kind of dumb when we&#39;re holding hands and you start spouting off some shit about how &quot;god&quot; created the world. I don&#39;t know what you see in me, I&#39;m just a nihilistic fuck pursuing an art degree.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c4">Love is showing you who I am. It&rsquo;s being excited to show you all of my dirt, my seeds, my growth. It&rsquo;s someone who waters you. Loving you is digging and watering you. Taking all the junk from inside. Maybe I&rsquo;m different. Maybe the diamond isn&rsquo;t my love. I&rsquo;m an ephemeral piece of organic matter. My garden of dirt is all these pieces of media that make me happy. I want to bury myself here. What dirt does a diamond need? It&rsquo;s pure.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c4">I want to die in the woods so that bugs will clean off everything but my bones. But I won&rsquo;t be a beautiful skeleton, like a fox or a deer. I&rsquo;ll be just a human skeleton, there to spook somebody. A dead deer isn&rsquo;t scary because you can&rsquo;t relate to it. It&rsquo;s just a beautiful piece of matter. A human skeleton is someone who you imagine feeling pain. Even though they&rsquo;re dead and can&rsquo;t feel it, we&rsquo;re sympathetic to their flesh being eaten.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c4">I&rsquo;d be a beautiful Halloween decoration for some woods somewhere. Maybe a witch would find me and use my bones for a spell or a soup.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c4">We had a porch at the childhood house. We had a screen door and the sun would set through the door, and everything would be blue and cool. I remember one night we had Art over, and he was smoking a cigarette on the porch. The light from the cigarette was orange, and the smoke smelled warm and dusty. I was alive, and Art was alive at the same time too. I was knowing things he couldn&rsquo;t know, and I still am, here, knowing. Feelings I couldn&rsquo;t share.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c4">I loved myself before I was spun out. When I left Trinidad, I really wanted everything fast. I wanted the life I missed. I wanted acid and sex with my lover. I couldn&rsquo;t get enough. I wanted redemption for being missing. As I imagined being missing, I imagined being one with something I didn&rsquo;t know. I saw all the different parts of my mind on display, reviewed them and threw out each one. I threw up my soul as everyone else got in the bubble. They blew up a bubble bigger and bigger until it consumed the whole culture. Everyone grew up without me.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c4">As I lost my mind I remembered the names of all the people I knew one last time. I remembered names of people I followed online, this is it. We&rsquo;re all connected. I was real. I was there. I was lost and alone, crying and dying, wishing someone would come but not wanting them to see. I had to keep it together for my lover. I spilled everything out onto the streets. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c4">The sky cried for me, there was a big storm. People gathered at the bridge to show me not to kill myself. A rainbow arched over the city to show me I was protected. But Ruben never came. Ruben never drove by and said hey Luke, get in. We&rsquo;re going on a road trip. You&rsquo;re the only one that matters to me and I want to explore myself with you. We&rsquo;re going to listen to music and talk and sleep in the back of the car and I&rsquo;m going to love you so much even though you&rsquo;re pointless, because you deserved it all this time. It didn&rsquo;t happen. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c4">I was too old.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">We&#39;re too old</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">We&#39;re not old at all</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">Just too old</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We&#39;re not old at all</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m brown. Deep brown. The color of my house&rsquo;s shed. I&rsquo;m dirt, like I said multiple times, I&rsquo;m grunge, I&rsquo;m dust, and I&rsquo;m scum. I&rsquo;m the organic matter on the floor, the minerals.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My last will and testament is: Keep my website up. Put it in the internet archive. Put it in another internet archive until the internet ends. I hope I have friends who can help with that. Maybe Mozai will put me up in memory of HSG. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m not horrible. I&rsquo;m just dirty. I&rsquo;m made of mess. I&rsquo;m clutter. I find stuff and keep it, I look at it and feel something about it and collect it until I die, until I get a disease. I love music, plants, the colors of my hometown at the twilight hour, deer, juniper berries and sagebrush. I want to keep everyone I meet, I love you all and I want you to live in my hometown with me so I won&rsquo;t be alone, we can all be safe and creative, and it&rsquo;ll be cheap to live there. I&rsquo;m sorry I hurt anybody, I&rsquo;m part of the earth and sometimes the earth is a painful thing. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m a fine, purple mist, and inside that mist you can create anything you want, you can be in your own space, and time doesn&rsquo;t exist. Whenever you want to be with me just think of a purplish smoke. I am always missing you, tired without you. I&rsquo;m there when you are lonely and tired and full of hope for beauty. I&rsquo;m a point in time when the future was a solace. I&rsquo;m dreaming of you. I am the dream. And death is just a dream. I can&rsquo;t wait to be with you all, my memories.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">1994-(?)</span></p></body></html>

you can create this sticker as you please. But I ask that you please do not profit from it.

<p><i>the story of the sticker</i></p>
<p>
i am part of a culture of young kids who were raised on the internet. through thick and thin, we supported each other. there was a story we all shared, and we used the characters to express ourselves. the name of that story was homestuck. when i was a kid, i felt stuck in poverty in isolation. every emo song sings of <i>this town</i>, but i'm really from that town. i traveled for a long time. i fell in love with the streets. i met kids who are like me. for just a moment i felt what i always wanted to feel. i drew this in a hotel room as small as a closet, full of pride and joy. this sticker contains all of that energy. we're gays at home.

you can create this sticker as you please. But I ask that you please do not profit from it.

<p><i>the story of the sticker</i></p>
<p>
i am part of a culture of young kids who were raised on the internet. through thick and thin, we supported each other. there was a story we all shared, and we used the characters to express ourselves. the name of that story was homestuck. when i was a kid, i felt stuck in poverty in isolation. every emo song sings of <i>this town</i>, but i'm really from that town. that town has a small trans history, but it wasn't enough for me. i wanted home to be in this intangible place on the internet. but i was too poor to even have internet access. i arrived in a city with a big trans history. i left home, loved and lost, fucked and fucked up a lot. it was harrowing. i was outside and dirty a lot. but when i had time, i incorporated characters from that story into my life. i felt them becoming adults with me. i drew this in a hotel room as small as a closet, in a flurry of joy and self-acceptance of the good and bad. this sticker contains all of that energy. we're all gays at home. educated by the screen and the street, homestuck and homeless with the space, time, breath, and blood around us and in us.

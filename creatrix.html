GREEN: but what does "truscum" really mean? is it the people who believe in those brain structures? is it everyone who has those brain structures?
GREEN: if so that would mean every trans person.
RED: but when you assign gender to those structures it's gender. your brain's not gender
GREEN: i understand that. but that's philosophy. my question is why are you trying to change my way of looking at the world? what is the effect of doing that?
RED: uh it sounds like you're trying to paint me as something i'm not
GREEN: no, i'm not. i have no assumptions on who you are. that's why i'm asking you? i want you to really think about it.
RED: no i'm not silencing you as a trans person or whatever.
GREEN: that's not what i'm saying

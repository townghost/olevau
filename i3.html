        hello. my name is moody. i'm a person from the internet. with this site, i hope to tell stories at the end of the world. </div>
      <div class="textlog">
        while every story is true to some aspect of my perception, a certain level of creativity will be preserved to protect the truth.</div>
      <div class="textlog">
        the original owner of this site is no longer here, and no longer relevant. we should not look for him. he is tired.</div>

              <div class="textlog"><p><i>what is olevau?</i><br>
              it's a word my friend invented. it's the name of the website. the etymology is "moot is olev" and "AU" for alternate universe. you can tell most people anything and they'd believe it.</p></div>

              <div class="textlog"><p><i>is this site safe for minors?</i><br>no, this site is for severely mentally ill adults. i recommend you should have been at at least 15 during the entire running of homestuck, and also have hated homestuck, to enter the site. </p></div>

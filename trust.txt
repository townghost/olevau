trust.
being able to tell someone, i really like this.
this makes me feel good.
and have them understand.
it's like having your bike stolen.
one minute it's there, under you, making you fly.
the next it belongs to someone else.
look ruben! i wrote something again. to tell the world how i feel about you.
since i can't tell you.
they'll see it's not creepy?

and trust is a funny thing.
even though you're so long gone, you're nothing more than a concept.
the place i want to be there that's gone, the circle of trust that is empty,
is still named ruben.

if you were here, you'd condescendingly ask me, do you feel better now that you let it out?
and i can't say anything.
it hurts, but...
i still believe the pain will be over.
i still believe you're big enough that, if i flew as far as i could, exhausting myself, i'd still land in you.
it's both real and not real, since you are still a person.
it is still you, for now, since we're both still alive.
but who i feel you are and who you are are two different people.
you're cold and cruel.
but the only thing i remember is when you made me feel warm.
since i'm the toxic one, i'm supposed to be cut off. i'm supposed to just somehow disappear. i'm not supposed to exist in the same world.
cut out toxic people from your life.
but i'm somehow still a person.

somehow the toxic is hurting me still.
the toxic feels like getting your bike stolen.
one moment it's there, the next it belongs to someone else.
you might see that bike, you might see the motherfucker riding it,
but ain't nothing you can say or do to make it yours again.
what should trust feel like?

I&rsquo;m supposed to take my testosterone yesterday. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m very private about this because most of the trans community doesn&rsquo;t support me, they don&rsquo;t think that being transsexual is a medical condition. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think it is. I just don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything wrong with that.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I like the disability community. Communities around things like autism and ADHD make me feel much more safe than the political movement surrounding the trans issue. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I feel like what i&rsquo;m trying to describe about myself is best described by the spiritual. The pure awareness that they talk about, that&rsquo;s what i feel like i&rsquo;m trying to describe to my community, endlessly.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seems like everyone&rsquo;s ready with a way to explain away my existence.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Like there&rsquo;s no way to win at being openly transsexual. There&rsquo;s no way to explain myself. So this motivates my transition. Like, i&rsquo;ll never escape from being observed. The only way to exist is to perform myself. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I used to run with a bunch of radical feminists, because they were the only people i saw talking about the horror of being observed. But in exchange they demanded the dissolution of myself so i was again without answers. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You know&hellip; gender is a disease of the mind. Like racism, it&rsquo;s a core assumption about the character of who you observe. Even in a close relationship, it&rsquo;s hard to get past the body.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You know in this world, there are humans who would seek to punish people like me with forced impregnation. It&rsquo;s a fetish. A little bit of my joy is depriving them of that.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My feelings toward my reproductive system are a little bit soiled by the memories of my mother exposing herself to me. Some kind of feminist act, some kind of sign i probably shouldn&rsquo;t ever deal with feminism during the course of my life. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The cult of it at least, the idea that women can never abuse or do wrong, or that the idea of femaleness doesn&rsquo;t contain a little stagnation and disease. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since i am a transsexual, i moved to san francisco to get my surgeries, try to get a job and live healthily. But i&rsquo;m so much more than that. I&rsquo;m a human. I have needs and desires equal to anyone else.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Being Human</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The state of being human, what comes with being in a human body, without all the bells and whistles of it. I&rsquo;ve thought extensively about it, but i still don&rsquo;t think i know --?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Being human comes with -- searching for food. Searching for warmth. Searching for other humans, some humans that match in some way. That act in a way you can understand.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The people of the streets are so enthusiastic to come together to pool the results of their wealth. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was homeless for a while. I lived in the state of being human without all the bells and whistles of it. I still had some of the bells. I was raised by a mother. At some point, i had a home and food. I was educated.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was trying to tell a story. That time, i wanted to tell some kind of story to somebody about who i am. I didn&rsquo;t want to passively let people observe me and tell some kind of story about who i am. All of this time, hidden needs were working inside me. I looked like a monkey. I looked for food.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought i needed to know somebody, but all i needed was to be alone. I was telling the story to myself, over and over, so i wouldn&rsquo;t forget who i am.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The knife</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The knife is one of the most important tools of the human. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without a knife, a human is missing a limb. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To go under the knife is to get a surgery. To let another human cut you to help you. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A knife is safety and trust. I want to live &ldquo;under the knife&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The city</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A city is a settlement of humans. People work together to pool the results of their wealth. With their wealth, the people have allowed me to go under the knife, to cut me in order to heal me.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The city, the spirits, and the knife</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I used to carry a knife. I used to be very forgetful and would just keep forgetting and losing my knife. I imagined a reason for this scenario. I imagined that i was part of a secret tribe in the city that was watching me closely. These people took away my knife, so i would learn to be soft. I would learn to be safe without the threat of pain. Or maybe they were spirits. Maybe the people weren&rsquo;t here in this physical plane, but i imagined this reason why, and i stopped carrying a knife.</span></p><div><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p></div></body></html>

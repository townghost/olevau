BLUE: think of how fucking lonely god must have been to created this world
BLUE: how fucking angry and alone you have to be to muster up enough energy to create something like that
BLUE: this kind of twisted jerry-rigged system where everybody is everybody
BLUE: you must hate yourself

RED: i'm not lonely
RED: people visit me all the time lol
RED: my favorite color isn't even red. it's green
RED: dark green

BLUE: well my favorite color is blue so maybe i'm biased.


but he didn't care about colors. he didn't have a favorite anything.

everything is eclectic. a little orange, a little blue, a lot of dark green, all of it black.
to create is a depressing duplication of the same thing until it deletes itself. the wide range of colors all white deluding itself it's not black.


the happiest place to be is to pretend it's not the same. to pretend you have options.
